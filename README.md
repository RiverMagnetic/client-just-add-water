Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX. The backend is an API I built using Ruby on Rails and Postgresql (you can find the back end repo here: https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/api-rails-just-add-water and this is the back end's live URL: https://api-rails-just-add-water.herokuapp.com/).



Planning

Problems I Plan to Solve in Future Iterations

My main priorities are to add authentication and to make everything functional.

Additionally, I want to continue to work on the styling, both for the look of the mobile version and proper display for the desktop version.
