## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX. The backend is an API I built using Postgresql and Ruby on Rails.


## Problems I Plan to Solve in Future Iterations

My main priorities are to add authentication and to make everything functional.

Additionally, I want to continue to work on the styling, both for the look of the mobile version and proper display for the desktop version.
