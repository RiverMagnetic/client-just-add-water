## Just Add Water

This single page application is a gentle personal growth app, built for mobile use.

Currently users can sign up and create short journal entries. The app's resources are private to each user, so users can only create, read, update, and delete their own journal entries.

In future iterations users will also be able to set goals and note their progress towards those goals.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX. The backend is an API I built using Ruby on Rails and Postgresql (you can find the back end repo here: https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/api-rails-just-add-water and this is the back end's live URL: https://api-rails-just-add-water.herokuapp.com/).


## Problems I Plan to Solve in Future Iterations

My main priority is to get the UI in good shape throughout the app. 

Additionally, I want to continue to work on the styling, both for the look of the mobile version and proper display for the desktop version.
